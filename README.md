Autonomous Drone for Infrastructural Inspection
Project Overview
This repository hosts the codebase for an autonomous drone system designed for infrastructural inspections. The drone leverages advanced algorithms and sensors to navigate and analyze infrastructure, such as bridges, buildings, and power lines, providing valuable data for maintenance and safety assessments.

Features
Autonomous Navigation: Utilizes GPS and computer vision for precise navigation around complex structures.
Real-Time Analysis: Implements machine learning models for immediate identification of structural anomalies.
Data Collection: Gathers high-resolution images and sensor data for further analysis.
User-Friendly Interface: Includes a web-based dashboard for easy monitoring and control of inspection missions.
